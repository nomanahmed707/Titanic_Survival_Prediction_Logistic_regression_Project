# Titanic Survival Prediction: A Logistic Regression Approach

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! This Jupyter Notebook offers a comprehensive guide to building, evaluating, and understanding a Logistic Regression model for predicting passenger survival on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Utilizing the powerful `scikit-learn` library along with `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization, this notebook walks you through the essential steps of a machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

🔍 **Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration**
* Loading the iconic Titanic dataset using `fetch_openml`.
* Performing initial data inspection to understand its structure, columns, and data types (`.head()`, `.info()`).
* Identifying and visualizing missing values across features (`.isnull().sum()`, bar plots).

🛠 **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**
* Creating new, informative features such as `family` (combining `sibsp` and `parch`) and `travelled_alone`.
* Handling categorical variables through **One-Hot Encoding** (e.g., for 'sex' and 'embarked') to prepare them for model training.
* Applying **Data Scaling** techniques (`StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`) to numerical features, ensuring uniform contribution to the model and improving convergence.

📊 **Model Building & Training**
* Implementing **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental classification algorithm, to predict survival outcomes.
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets to rigorously evaluate model performance.
* *Exploration of additional models:* The notebook also briefly explores `KNeighborsRegressor` and `RandomForestClassifier` for comparison or alternative approaches.

📈 **Model Evaluation**
* Assessing the Logistic Regression model's performance using key classification metrics:
    * **Accuracy Score**: Overall correctness of predictions.
    * **Confusion Matrix**: A detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
    * **Precision**: The accuracy of positive predictions (minimizing false positives).
    * **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ability of the model to find all positive samples (minimizing false negatives).
    * **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* Visualizing the Confusion Matrix using `seaborn.heatmap` for intuitive interpretation.
